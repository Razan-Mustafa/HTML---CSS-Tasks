        The Cockatiel is a delightful and charming bird that is popular as 
        a pet around the world. With its distinctive crest and beautiful 
        plumage, the cockatiel is easily recognizable. These small parrots
        are native to Australia and are known for their friendly and sociable 
        nature. Cockatiels make wonderful companions as they are intelligent, 
        affectionate, and have the ability to mimic sounds and even words.
        They enjoy interacting with their human caregivers and can be
        trained to perform various tricks. Cockatiels are also known for
        their melodious whistling and chirping, adding a cheerful ambiance
        to any household. They thrive on a diet of seeds, fruits, and
        vegetables and require a spacious cage with toys and perches for mental
        and physical stimulation. With proper care and attention, a cockatiel
        can bring joy and companionship to its owners for many years.
