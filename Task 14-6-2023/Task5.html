        My Hobbies are: <br>
        In my free time, I enjoy playing games that offer a challenges and require inteligence.
        Also, I'm always eager to learn new things and take on new challenges.<br>
        I'M skilled in quilling. Quilling, also known as paper filigree, is a decorative
        art form that involves rolling, shaping, and gluing narrow strips of paper to create 
        intricate designs. The process typically starts with rolling the paper strips using a
        quilling tool to form various shapes such as circles, teardrops, or spirals.
        These shapes are then arranged and glued together to create intricate patterns,
        flowers, animals, and other designs. Quilling can be done on flat surfaces, 
        such as cards or frames, or used to embellish three-dimensional objects. 
        It requires precision, patience, and creativity to master this delicate art form. <br><br>
        This is example of quilling:
